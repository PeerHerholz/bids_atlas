    "Description": "Destrieux cortical atlas is based on a parcellation scheme
                    that first divided the cortex into gyral and sulcal regions,
                    the limit between both being given by the curvature value of the surface.
                    A gyrus only includes the cortex visible on the pial view, the hidden cortex (banks of sulci) 
                    are marked sulcus.\nThe result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri.",
